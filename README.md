ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Itay Last
Im teaching and learning C#
I started coding in fifth grade learning Java later went on to learn some python
and made some twitter bots using it.
During the lockdowns caused by COVID-19 I started learning C# on my own and made Gird-ify.com
Which a calander made for learning from home, it allowed you to enter your classes info (Name, Day, time)
and it would even open them automatically for you at the right time.
I went on to take comp-sci in highschool and using my exprience I tutored fellow classmates and organized after school classes

Also big fun of graphic design and I design clothes and more professionally for companies
